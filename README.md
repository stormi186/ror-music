  - Users can register an account, create/delete their playlists, add/remove songs to the playlists, favorite/unfavorite songs (CRUD)
  - They can browse artists, songs, genres, search and listen to the songs that open up on youtube
  - There is a sidebar with top 5 songs(ones the users favorited the most)
  - There is also a sidebar with 5 recently added albums
  - There are three roles (user, admin(can add and delete his data) and superadmin(can add and delete everyone's data))
