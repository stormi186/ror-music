 * Material Design Responsive Table
 * Tested on Win8.1 with browsers: Chrome 37, Firefox 32, Opera 25, IE 11, Safari 5.1.7
 * You can use this table in Bootstrap (v3) projects. Material Design Responsive Table CSS-style will override basic bootstrap style.
 * JS used only for table constructor: you don't need it in your project
